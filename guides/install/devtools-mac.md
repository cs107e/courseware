These are the instructions for installing the development tools on macOS. We peppered the installation instructions with <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-lg"></i> __Check__ steps that confirm your progress through the steps. Use each to validate a step before moving on.  If you hit a snag, stop and reach out (forum, office hours) and we can help you out!

## Install Homebrew/Xcode

To ease the installation process, we are using Homebrew.
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a popular [package
manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) for OS X.

If you already use Homebrew, skip to the next section; otherwise follow these steps.

- Homebrew requires the Xcode command line tools which can be installed by running the command below.
    ```console
    $ xcode-select --install
    ```

- Install Homebrew by running this command.
    ```console
    $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm Homebrew installation" %}
```console
$ brew -v
Homebrew 4.2.0
```
Fine if your version number is newer!

## Install riscv-unknown-elf toolchain and xfel
We prepared a brew package containing the cross-compile toolchain and xfel
utility need to compile and run programs on the Mango Pi.

Use homebrew to install our custom brew package.
```console
$ brew install cs107e/cs107e/riscv-gnu-toolchain-13
```

{% include checkstep.html content="confirm compiler" %}
```console?prompt=$
$ brew info riscv-gnu-toolchain-13

Nice job! Head back to the [main installation guide](../devtools) to do one last set of checks.
