CS107e has limited enrollment due to constraints on lab space. We choose the course cohort before the start of the quarter to aid students with their planning.

The student questionnaire will open after the info session and it will close on December 20th. Prospective students must fill out the questionnaire to be considered. We will notify you about enrollment decisions by end of year.
