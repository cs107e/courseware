### Goals

Lab this week will be a working meeting with your team. You are nearing halfway point, and hopefully have made a good headway so far and see a clear path from here to finish line!

* How has teamwork been so far?
    * planning, dividing up tasks, supporting each other
    * using git in collaboration with team, push/pull/merge
    * communication and coordination across time and space
* How did you do on meeting your week 1 goals?  How do you feel about your path from here to completion?
* What can we do to help you finish strong?
* Be planning about how to best show off your creation during the demo session.
