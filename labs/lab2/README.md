## Goals
During this lab you will:
- Read the assembly language produced by `gcc` when compiling a C program.
- Review the use of basic makefiles.
- Learn how to use `assert` as a simple unit test.
- Begin breadboarding a 4-digit 7-segment display for your next assignment, the clock.

## Prelab preparation

To prepare for this lab, please do the following:

1. Organize your supplies to bring to lab
    - Bring your laptop (with full charge) and CS107e parts kit.
    - If you have your own [hand tools](/guides/handtools), bring them along!
2. From our course guides, please review:
    -  [gcc guide](/guides/gcc) on compile C programs for bare metal
   programming on the Mango Pi
    -  [make guide](/guides/make) on the structure of makefiles
3. Read [section 4a below](#crossref) on the theory of operation
   for 7-segment displays and skim the rest of exercise 4 to get the lay of the land for the breadboarding work.
4. Watch this excellent tutorial video from Ben Eater <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE-_rJqvDhQ> on best practices for breadboarding. Ben is the 🐐!

## Lab exercises
The lab has four exercises. The recommended division of time is to use the first hour for exercises 1,2, and 3 (e.g. ~20 minutes each) and reserve the second hour for breadboarding in exercise 4. We do not expect that you will build the complete breadboard during lab, but an hour should get you a solid start, leaving with have a clear understanding of how to finish it on your own.

If you have to skimp a bit on the codegen/make/testing exercises during lab, try to circle back when you have time to make a fuller exploration. If you run into any issues or have follow-up questions, post on Ed or come by office hours to talk with us about it!

### 0. Pull lab starter code

Change to your local `mycode` repo and pull in the lab starter code:

```console
$ cd ~/cs107e_home/mycode
$ git checkout dev
$ git pull code-mirror lab2-starter
```

### 1. C to assembly (20 min)

Compilers are truly an engineering marvel. Translating C source into a appropriate use of assembly instructions, registers, and memory necessitates both technical mastery and a fair bit of artistry. From here forward in the course, you'll hand over the task of writing assembly to `gcc`, but you will continue to grow your reading fluency of assembly. For this exercise, you will observe and pay tribute to the handiwork of the compiler.

Sometimes the assembly
produced by the C compiler can be surprising. You will be pleased by its clever optimizations, although occasionally its eagerness can also remove or rearrange your code in ways that confound your intentions. When this happens to you, you can deploy your assembly superpowers to dig into the generated
assembly and figure out what the compiler did rather that sit
there dumbfounded by the unexpected behavior!

Change to the `lab2/codegen` directory. Open the `codegen.c` source file in
your text editor. The file contains functions that demonstrate arithmetic, control flow, and pointers. Skim the C code and read our comments to get the lay of the land.

Open <https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/3YrvehK9q> in your browser; this is Compiler Explorer configured to match our `RISC-V gcc` toolchain with split panes on the right to show generated assembly at two different optimization levels (`-Og` and `-O2`).

In `codegen.c`, find the section marked `Part (a): arithmetic`. Paste the functions one by one into the Compiler Explorer source pane on the left and review the generated assembly shown on the right. Verify that the assembly accomplishes what was asked for in the C source. Do you note any surprising choices in how it goes about it?  Read our comments in `codegen.c` as the guide for what to look for and what follow-up experiments to try.

After you finish exploring Part a, do the same with the other parts in `codegen.c`. Part (c) has an example of the need for `volatile` that is particularly relevant for your next assignment.

The final part includes some C code for which the generated assembly is somewhat surprising -- examine those closely to understand what is happening and why. When C code ventures outside the boundary of legal C, it is said to have "undefined behavior" and the compiler has a lot of latitude in how it can handle it.  Check out this article for more examples <https://embeff.com/compiler-dependent-behaviour-in-practice/>

A good way to learn how a system works is by trying
things. Curious about a particular C construct is translated to assembly? Wonder about the effect of changing the compiler optimization level? Try it out and see. Keep that link to Compiler Explorer handy and let your curiosity be your guide!


### 2. Makefiles (20 min)

Change to the directory `lab2/makefiles` and review the C source for a program that blinks the ACT led and its simplified Makefile, reproduced below:

```makefile
NAME = blink_actled

ARCH = -march=rv64im -mabi=lp64
CFLAGS = $(ARCH) -g -Og -Wall -ffreestanding
LDFLAGS = -nostdlib -e main

all: $(NAME).bin

%.bin: %.elf
	riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy $< -O binary $@

%.elf: %.o
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

%.o: %.c
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -f *.o *.elf *.bin

.PRECIOUS: %.o %.elf
```

(If you did not finish pre-lab reading [make guide](/guides/make), do it now!)

Go through the Makefile with your tablemates to identify its components and add comments to document the various structures (variables, targets, recipes, pattern rules, etc.).

- Trace what happens when you issue `make` with no command-line arguments. What target does `make` build by default? How does it determine which actions to take to build that target?
- If you edit `blink-actled.c` and run `make` again, which commands are re-run?
- If you remove just the file `blink-actled.bin` and `make`, just one command is re-run. Which is it? Why is this different that before? How does `make` determine which commands must be re-run?
- What does `make clean` do?

#### Make run
After building a program, you use the `mango-run` command to load and execute on the Pi. It would be handy for that action to be a part of the Makefile, let's add it now! Open `Makefile` in your editor and add a new target `run`. The dependency for the `run` is the program binary file.  By listing it as a dependency, the run target automatically rebuilds the program when needed. The recipe for `run` invokes `mango-run` on the program file. Try out `make run` now.

### 3. Testing (20 min)
<a href="testing"></a>
An effective developer knows testing goes hand-in-hand with writing code. The better your tests and more timely your efforts, the sooner you will find your bugs and the easier your debugging will be. To help you grow this important skill, assignments will include a required testing component along with our guidance on testing structure and strategies.

The standard C library offers an `assert` macro for use as a simple diagnostic. In CS106B, you constructed test cases using SimpleTest `STUDENT_TEST` and `EXPECT`. The C `assert` serves a similar purpose, although much less sophisticated.
In your terminal, use the command `man assert` to learn about the standard library version. The `assert` macro is invoked on an expression that is expected to evaluate to true. If the expression evaluates to be true, the assertion succeeds and the program continues on.  If the expression is false, the assertion fails which cause the program to print an error message and exit.

Running bare metal means no standard libraries, and furthermore we don't have printf (yet!). To get something akin to `assert`, we have to cobble it up ourselves and given our limited resources, it will be rather primitive. There is an blue "ACT" (activity) LED onboard the Mango Pi that we will use to signal success and failure. Our bare bones `assert` is going to blink the blue ACT LED to report a failure.

Let's walk through an example that shows using assertions as rudimentary testing tool.

#### A buggy program

Change to the `lab2/testing` directory. The program in `testing.c` defines the `count_bits` function to count the on bits in a given number.  Each test case in `main()` calls `count_bits` on an input and asserts that the result is correct. The function `count_bits` works correctly for some inputs but not all. Do not try to work out what the bug is by inspection, instead let's see how we can using test cases to narrow down to cases.

#### What do you expect?

First, let's review what we expect to
happen when executing the test program. If a test case fails, the `assert` macro will call `abort`. What does `abort` do? Read the comments in the file `testing.c` to find out!

Now look at the code in the file `cstart.c` to see what happens after the
program runs to completion, i.e., what follows after `main()` finishes? (Skim past the `bss` stuff for now: we will talk about it in an upcoming lecture.)

Check in with your neighbor and confirm you understand what will happen on the Pi :
- if the program executes a single test of `count_bits` on a value that has a bug?
- if the program executes a single test of `count_bits` on a value that works correctly?
- if the program executes several `count_bits` tests, some which pass and some which fail?
  + This last one is a particularly important to understand. Unlike SimpleTest, a sequence of test cases (asserts) does not produce a report of pass/fail results, one per test. It stops at the first failure.

#### Make test

The Makefile for this program has a `test` target that builds the program and executes it on the Pi. Try `make test` now. The program runs and the blue ACT LED starts blinking. Hmmm, that means at least one test failed, but which one?

Divide and conquer to the rescue! Leave in the first half of the test cases and comment out the remainder. Rebuild and re-run. If the program still fails, you know you have a culprit in the first half; otherwise you can move on to looking in the second half. The strategy is to iterate, selectively commenting in/out
test cases and re-running to narrow in on which specific cases fail.
How many of the test cases pass? How many fail?  Which ones? Why?

Study the test results to identify the pattern to the failures. Use that information to find and fix the bug in `count_bits` so that it works correctly for all inputs.

Keep in mind that your test cases are implemented as code, which means that they, too, can have bugs of their own. Having a bug in your test case can truly be a maddening experience! A test case that produces a false negative can lead you to investigate a non-existent defect and a false positive lulls you into overlooking a lurking one. You attribute the erroneous test result to the code being tested, yet the real issue is that the test case itself is mis-constructed. Unlike hackneyed sitcom plots, hilarity does not ensue from this misunderstanding.

A test case that is properly constructed should assert an expression that will be true if and only if the code is correct. The last test case in `main` shows an example of a mis-constructed test case. What happens when running this test case on the original broken code? What happens on the now-corrected code? Fix the error in the test case so that it works as intended.

Uncomment all test cases, rebuild, re-test, and enjoy the quiet sign of successful completion!

__Test your understanding__: You run a program with a sequence of 10 asserts on the Pi and get the flashing light of doom. What strategy could you use to narrow in and identify which test case(s) is failing? What happens if the program has a bug in a test case that causes it to enter an infinite loop-- what then would you expect to be the observed behavior when testing?

### 4. Wire up display breadboard (60 min)

The second half of the lab period is directed toward the breadboard circuit needed for Assignment 2, a clock implemented on a 4-digit 7-segment display unit.

The lab exercise below guides you in stages and has you test each stage before moving on.
This "test as you go" strategy is the hallmark of a great engineer. Do not cut corners in a mad rush to finish the entire circuit in lab! The goal for the lab session is that you understand the schematic, get a solid start on wiring it up, and leave lab ready to complete the rest on your own.

#### 4a) Theory of operation

Start by understanding how a single 7-segment display works.
![7-segment](images/display.segments.png){: .float-right .d-inline}
The 7-segment display, as its name implies, is comprised of 7 individually lightable LEDs, labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. There is also a decimal point labeled DP, which we will not be using. Each segment is an LED. Recall that an LED has an anode and a cathode. The polarity matters for an LED; the anode voltage must be positive relative to the cathode for the LED to be lit. If the cathode is positive with respect to the anode, the segment is not lit.

On the 7-segment display we use,
the cathodes (ground) are all connected to a shared ground.
Such a display is called *common cathode*.

![Common Cathode](images/display.common.cathode.png){: .zoom}

To show a digit on the display, you create a circuit by connecting the
common cathode to ground and applying a voltage to the desired segment
pins. Turning on all seven segments would show the digit `8`.

The clock display in your kit has four 7-segment displays integrated into a single unit:

![4-digit, 7-segment display](images/display.jpg){: .zoom .w-25}

#### Datasheets
Here is the [datasheet for the 5641-AS](/readings/7segment_5641AS.pdf) display unit. A datasheet is your go-to when learning a new component. It will lay out the specifications, schematic, pinout diagram, operational behavior, testing data, and more. In practice, datasheets vary a lot in how well they present the information.  In our writeup below, we extracted the essential facts from the datasheet to get you started. Learning to read a datasheet found in the wild is a good skill to work at developing.

This is the internal schematic of the four-digit 7-segment display unit:

![7-segment schematic](images/display.schematic.png){: .zoom .w-75}

Untangling the connections can be a bit tricky. There are twelve pins in total: four digit pins (`DIG.1`, `DIG.2`, `DIG.3`, and `DIG.4`) and eight segment pins (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `DP`). Each segment pin connects to all four digits; start at the pin numbered 11 and follow its connections to the `A` segment for each digit. Each digit has its own unique ground, e.g. `DIG.1` is the cathode/ground pin for digit 1. Trace out how each segment connects to the shared digit grounds.

If you turn on segment pins `B` and `C` and connect `DIG.1` and `DIG.2` to ground, the first
and second digits both show `"1"` while the third and
fourth digits do not show anything, because they are not connected to ground.

Below is the pinout for the display unit. Note that the `DIG.1`,
`DIG.2`, `DIG.3`, and `DIG.4` labels have been shortened to `D1`, `D2`, `D3`, and `D4`. The pins are also numbered for reference. By convention, numbering starts at the bottom left corner (pin #1), and proceeds in a counter-clockwise fashion until reaching the upper left corner (pin #12).

![4-digit, 7-segment display](images/display.pinout.jpg){: .zoom}

#### 4b) Place resistors for segments

Safety first! Don a pair of safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying leads.

Start by connecting all of the breadboard power and ground rails to make accessing power and ground more convenient. Custom-fit a red wire that connects the upper power rail to the lower power rail and a black wire for the ground rails. If your breadboard has a mid-rail gap, connect over those with short red and black wires. The end result should be one fully connected rail for power and another for ground.

How do you know if your breadboard has a mid-rail gap? Check whether rail marking is a continuous line or has a break at mid-rail. The breadboard in the photo below has a gap. Click the image to zoom to see the markings. Note that the breadboard used in previous quarters did not have a gap, the photos in the rest of the guide use that board and it may look a little different than yours.

![Breadboard with tied rails](images/breadboard.rails.jpg){: .zoom }


> __Pro-tip__ When using the wire stripper, place the wire in the hole labeled with the gauge of

> <hr>
> Watch in the video below how Liana uses her tools to neatly fit a wire between two set points.
{: .callout-info}

![Fitting a wire](images/fitting_wire.gif)

My convention is to always orient my breadboard so that the blue ground rail is on
the bottom (after all, ground is underneath us). Insert your display unit in the middle of your breadboard, with the decimal points on the bottom and the digits slanted to the right.

![Breadboard with clock in position](images/breadboard.step0.jpg){: .zoom }

Take note of which column numbers on the breadboard align with pinout of the
display unit. When the display unit is inserted into the breadboard you can no longer
see the pins underneath, so you want to know which breadboard column aligns with each pin. We chose to place our display unit so __pin 1 is inserted into column 30 on the breadboard__.

The LEDs in the display unit require a current-limiting resistor just as the LEDs in your Larson scanner did. Place a 1K resistor bridging the middle of the breadboard to the right of the display unit. The resistor should sit neatly--- Liana shows how to use the pliers to make a sharp crease and clip the leads with the cutters for a nice secure fit.

![fitting a resistor](images/fitting_resistor.gif)

Now you will make some temporary connections to the display unit to test turning on a single segment. We recommend that you use jumper cables when making these temporary connections. After validating your circuit, you will re-wire it in a neater and more permanent fashion.

The first test connection is to turn on the single segment B of digit 1. Below is a schematic for the circuit you will need. Take a moment to identify all of the components in the schematic. (click image to enlarge)

![Schematic for segment B digit 1](images/schematic.step1.png){: .zoom }

- Follow the above schematic and build this test circuit on your breadboard.
	- Pick out three short male-male jumpers (orange for 3.3V, black for GND, and green).
	- Use the orange jumper to connect the red power rail to the top of the resistor.
	- Use the green jumper to connect the bottom of the resistor to segment B on the display unit. Consider: if pin 1 of the display unit is aligned with breadboard column 30, which column number aligns with the pin for segment B?
	- Use the black jumper to connect digit D1 on the display unit to the ground rail.
- Connect your breadboard to power and ground from your Mango Pi.
    - Pick out a pair of red and black male-female jumpers.
	- Use your ref card to identify 3.3V and ground pins on your Pi's header.
	- Use the red jumper to connect the 3.3V header pin to the power rail of the breadboard and the black to connect a ground header pin to the ground rail.

After tracing your circuit and confirming it is correctly constructed, power up the Pi. Segment B of the leftmost digit should light up (click photo to enlarge):

![Test circuit for segment B digit 1](images/breadboard.step1.jpg){: .zoom}

You can change which segment and digit is lit by moving the jumpers to different pins on the display unit.  (Remember to disconnect your breadboard from power while you are fiddling with the wiring) Try moving the black jumper from digit 1 to digit 2. Segment B of digit 1 turns off and segment B of digit 2 turns on. If you add a second black jumper that grounds digit 3, now segment B will light on __both__ digits.  Note
that you cannot simultaneously light different segments on different digits: Why not?

Place 6 more 1K resistors on your breadboard next to the first one, bringing the total to 7, one for each segment A-G (we will not wire the unused 8th segment DP). We
suggest a layout where the leftmost resistor is connected to segment A, its neighbor
is to segment B, and so on such that the rightmost resistor is segment G.

After you have placed all resistors, time to test. Simultaneously wiring all segments with 7
jumper cables would be very messy; instead connect one segment
at a time and move the jumper to test each of the 7 segments. As you go, make a
sketch of the correct connection between each resistor and its pin on the display unit and save
it to refer to when wiring up the permanent circuit.

Follow the schematic below and connect jumpers to show `"1 1 "` on the display unit. Here a space means that the digit is blank (no segments
turned on).

![Schematic for 1-1-](images/schematic.step2.png){: .zoom}

![Test circuit for 1-1-](images/breadboard.step2.jpg){: .zoom}

__Test your understanding__.
- Which connections must be made to show `"3"` on the first digit?
- Which additional connections are needed to show `"3333"` across all four digits?
- Why is it impossible to simultaneously show `"3"` on the first digit and `"4"` on the second? (The trick to doing so, as you will see in the assignment, is to quickly switch between digits to create the illusion of displaying `"34"`)


#### 4c) Place transistors for digits

Up to now, you have been controlling whether a digit is on by adding or
removing a jumper that connects the digit pin to ground. We eventually want to
programmatically control which segments and digits are turned on,
so we need an electronic switch that can be controlled by a GPIO pin.
To do this we will use bipolar-junction transistors, or BJTs.

A transistor has three terminals— the base (B), collector (C), and emitter (E).
The base controls the amount of current flowing from the collector to the
emitter. Normally, no current flows from collector to emitter. This condition
is an open circuit. However, if you apply 3.3V to the base, the collector will
be connected to the emitter and current will flow. This is equivalent to
closing the switch.

We are using 2N3904 transistors. Here is the [2N3904 datasheet](/readings/2N3904.pdf).
The diagram below identifies the pinout for the collector, base, and emitter connections.

![2n3904](images/2n3904.jpg){: .zoom .w-25}

The transistor cap has a flat side and a rounded side. If you are looking
at the flat side with the legs pointing down, the leftmost leg will be the
emitter.

Instead of wiring a digit pin directly to ground as before, you connect the digit pin to the collector of a transistor whose emitter is connected to ground.
Applying power to the transistor base activates the switch which then grounds the
digit pin.

Here are the steps to add the digit transistors to your breadboard:
- Disconnect all jumpers used for temporary connections from a digit to ground.
- Place four transistors in your breadboard to the left of your display unit. The layout is from left to right where leftmost transistor controls digit D1 and the
rightmost controls D4.  Use cutters to trim the transistor legs so that it sits neatly
against the breadboard.
- Custom-fit a black wire from the emitter of each transistor to ground.
- Place a 1K current-limiting resistor to protect the base of each transistor.
- In the permanent circuit, the collector of each transistor will have a custom-fit wire to its digit pin. For now, use jumpers as temporary connections.

Test your transistors by using jumpers to make temporary circuits. Below is a schematic and photo where we've connected _both_ D1 and D3 to the collectors of transistors and applied power to the bases of those two
transistors. This circuit displays `"1 1 "`.

![Schematic for 1-1- using transistors](images/schematic.step3.png){: .zoom .w-75}

![Test circuit for 1-1- using transistors](images/breadboard.step3.jpg){: .zoom .w-75}
![Closeup view of transistors](images/breadboard.step3.closeup.jpg){: .zoom .w-75}

#### 4d) Permanently wire circuit (start now, finish later)

Now comes the time-consuming part. Each segment pin needs to be connected to
its resistor and each digit pin connected to the collector of its transistor.
Be patient, this takes some time. Rather than do a rush job to finish in lab, 
instead practice with precise and neat wiring to develop your craft. Carefully
review the schematic and ask questions about anything you find unclear. We want
you to leave lab with confidence that you can complete the rest of the circuit on your own.

Here is a photo of the breadboard with all components placed, ready to start wiring...

![Wired breadboard with components](images/breadboard.components.jpg){: .zoom}

...and here is a full schematic of what you will be wiring up:

![Full schematic](images/schematic.full.png){: .zoom .w-75}

In the full schematic, the 3.3V input we've been using up to this point has been
replaced by labeled dots where you will connect M-F jumpers to the GPIO pins on the Pi. The dots in the upper right connect to the GPIOs that control the segments, the dots on the lower left are for the digits. As an example, turning on gpios PB4 and PB6 will light segment B of digit 1.

As you wire your breadboard, custom-fit your wires to the proper length and arrange them neatly.  When the circuit is tidy, it's easier to see if everything is set up correctly. If you didn't do a pre-lab watch of [Ben Eater's technique](#prelab-preparation), do it now!

![](images/badgood.jpg){: .zoom}

Take your time and test as you to go to check your work. A little bit of care will save you a lot of time later, because, if your system has a bug, the set of things that you have to check is much smaller. For added readability of your circuit, use different colors of wire to annotate the wire's purpose. In our example breadboard shown below, we used green wire for the segments and purple for the digits. Within the group, we used white for the first wire (e.g. D1 and segment A) to remind of the proper orientation for the connections.

The finishing touch is to add a pushbutton that will start the clock. The button is not connected into the display circuit. It is wired to the power rail through a 10K pull-up resistor and connected to gpio PG13 to be read as an input. (If you did not finish the [button exercise from last week's lab](/labs/lab1#button), review it now!)

Here are photos of the completed breadboard, looking sharp! Ben Eater would be proud!
