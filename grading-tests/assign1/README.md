# Assignment 1 - Larson Scanner

In this assignment students practice writing a non-trivial assembly program, and start to get practice developing for the pi.

This assignment much lighter than later assignments and is not autograded. However, we use a series of manual tests as a checklist for grading since most students are able to successfully complete this assignment.

See the `GRADING.ini` file for the grading tests.
