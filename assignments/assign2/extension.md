title: "Notes on Assign2 extension"
---

This is the first time we are trying this new extension for the clock assignment. You will be our pioneers!
Our goal is to give you a fun way to build on the work you put into your gpio/timer modules and perhaps
sprout a few inspirations that resurface in final projects.


Here are some notes on the devices that you might find helpful.


### Inputs
- Rotary encoder knob
  - Can turn clockwise or counterclockwise, and press. You can also turn while pressing. Satisfying mechanical feel.
  - Seat in breadboard with a little bit of prodding.
  - We have lots of these.  I also have a handful of a different type without center press where knob has LED that turns on/off.
- 5-way navigation switch
  - Like a mini-joystick, rock to compass points (NSEW), press in center. Buttons are exclusive.
  - I have just a few of these and they have sad, spindly legs don't seat well in a breadboard - Boo!
  - However, I ordered some from different manufacturer to arrive on Friday that may be better. Also building a breakout on perfboard might help. Stay tuned.
- Membrane keybpad
  - Reports press of single and multiple concurrent buttons.
  - Number pad gives clear affordance to user, but fewer options for creativity.
  - Has dupont connector, easy to run jumpers to breadboard.
  - I have a half-dozen of these.

### Outputs

- Passive buzzer
  - Tiny little speaker, sound quality not bad.
  - Fun for playing notes or making sound effects
  - Seats like a champ on a breadboard
  - I have a ton of these
- Common cathode RGB LED
  - Perfect on a breadboard
  - Tweaking resistor value per individual RGB may help with achieving a more balanced white (R dominates otherwise)
  - I have plenty of these
- Vibrating disc motor
  - Tiny lead wires not great for direct connect to breadboard (wiggles out when vibrating). Recommend soldering a graft to wire/jumper for sturdier connection.
  - Motor is plucky for its size. Try attaching to a coin and sit on a desk to further amplify the motion.
  - I have about 20 of these

Come find me (Julie) to pick up a device. We ask that you return the input device to us so we can reuse them, but you are welcome to keep the output device.

If you have a different device of your own that you want to use instead, let's talk!
